            <p>Ge10a - Section C</p><br>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">&emsp;&emsp;Hello! and welcome to my Ge10 website, here is a short information about me; I was born in Pasig city on June 1, 2006 and was raised in Samar for 2 years, afterwards, we moved to Baguio city. I grew up in Baguio city until I was 9 years old where we again moved, this time to Dipolog city where we lived until I graduated high school which by then, we moved again here in Dumaguete city. Now I live in Bacong, taking up Computer Science here at Silliman University.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">&emsp;&emsp;I like making art, particularly through drawings, sketches and painting. I also enjoy playing around with technology and I believe it to be the future hence why I took up Computer Science. Aside from technologies, I also enjoy solving equations particularly in fields of Theoretical physics such as Quantum mechanics, general and special relativity, and astrophysics. Aside from that, I am also knowledgeable in the fields of biology and psychology. In the past I had learned Jiu-jitsu as well as also joining the Red Cross Youth in Zamboanga del Norte Chapter as the Vice President for Internal affairs which helped to add knowledge of basic and advanced first aid.  I am a visual learner and I can process information at a very fast pace allowing me to copy certain actions just by seeing it once or twice. For sports, I play basketball, badminton, volleyball, baseball, chess and esports games like Mobile legends and Call of Duty.</p>
